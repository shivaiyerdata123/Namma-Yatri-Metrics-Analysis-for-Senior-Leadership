# Namma-Yatri-Metrics-Analysis-for-Senior-Leadership
Namma Yatri seeks to optimise its operations and gain deeper insights into ride patterns, customer behaviour, and operational bottlenecks. The goal is to uncover insights that can guide decisions to improve service efficiency, maximise revenue, and enhance customer satisfaction.

**Namma Yatri Auto Demand & Revenue Dashboard**

**Project Overview**

* This project presents a comprehensive analysis and visualization of Namma Yatri auto rickshaw operations using real-world trip data. The aim was to identify demand patterns, revenue trends, payment behaviors, and high-performing zones, and to generate actionable recommendations for improving operational efficiency.

* The dashboard and insights were created to assist Namma Yatri’s management team, transport planners, and policy stakeholders in optimizing fleet allocation, improving customer experience, and supporting data-driven decision-making.

**Tools & Technologies**

* Power BI – Data cleaning, transformation (DAX), and dashboard creation

* Tableau – Advanced visualizations and trend analysis

* Excel / CSV Processing – Initial data review and preparation

**Key Insights**

* Peak demand hours: 12–1 AM, 6–7 AM, and 1–2 PM, driven by shift workers and commuters.

* Top zones: Ramanagaram leads in trip volume (industrial hub + highway link), while Bangalore South generates the highest revenue (dense IT, residential, and retail mix).

* Payment methods: Credit card (26%) and cash (24%) are most used, with UPI adoption growing steadily.

* Cancellations: Customer-initiated cancellations (87%) are far higher than driver cancellations (47%).

* Conversion rate: Only 45% of trip searches result in completed rides — highlighting a need for improved driver-rider matching and pricing transparency.

**Recommendations**

* Resource allocation: Increase auto availability during peak demand hours and in high-performing zones.

* Reduce cancellations: Introduce transparent pricing, driver incentives, and mild penalties for frequent cancellations.

* Demand forecasting: Use historical data to predict spikes (festivals, office timings, weather) and proactively balance fleet supply.

* Operational efficiency: Optimize routes with traffic APIs, improve pickup spot accuracy, and minimize idle driver time.

* Marketing strategies: Run localized campaigns in high-demand zones, launch loyalty programs, and partner with corporates for bulk ride solutions.

**Methodology & Procedure**

* Data Import & Preparation

* Imported multiple datasets (Trips, Trip Details, Payments, Assembly, Duration).

* Cleaned inconsistent values, removed nulls/duplicates, and merged into a single dataset.

* Created calculated fields in Power BI and Tableau (e.g., conversion rate, revenue per trip, trip completion %).

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Classified variables into categorical/numerical.

* Identified demand peaks, revenue distribution, payment behavior, and cancellation patterns.

* Used heatmaps, treemaps, and pie charts for zone-wise and time-period analysis.

**Dashboard Development**

* Built interactive dashboards in Power BI & Tableau with parameters and filters for dynamic exploration.

* Enabled management to view driver earnings, trip completion, passenger distribution, and time-based demand.

**Insights & Recommendations**

* Synthesized findings into operational strategies (fleet optimization, pricing, marketing campaigns).

* Proposed measurable KPIs (cancellation rate, demand-supply ratio, driver utilization, on-time completion).
